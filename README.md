#Building an Apache-Solr based Search Engine and Ranking Algorithms for NSF and NASA Polar Datasets

##Description of session with Dr. Burgess
The objective of the hangout session was to discuss about how to come with science questions for the polar dataset. 
Dr. Burgess emphasized on the importance of sciencekeywords. She said the keywords would help us frame queries for 
the science questions we come up with. As we know, the data accumulated over projects and expeditions by polar scientists is hosted on the sites we crawled. Along with this data uploaded, thereis metadata associated. From this metadata we can find keywords to use in our queries. We were suggested to look into properties or fields such as description, attributes which
mention science keywords and spatial keywords. We talked about the geographic regions which encompass the polar regions and its importance. The spatial metadata provides bounding coordinates that cover the region from where the data was recorded.
She mentioned a data set which contains information accumulated from the entire world, hence it contains information about the polar regions as well. But it would be better to ignore that kind of data and consider the data set closer to the region we are
looking at. We extensively discussed of how the arctic conditions is associated with issues around the world such as oil, natural resources, global warming, rising sea levels and national security. So, the question should be formed such that we can cover different topics which are directly or indirectly affected by polar data.
